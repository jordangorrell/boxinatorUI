# To Run

- Clone repository
- In command prompt, cd to where you cloned the repo, then run
  - 'npm install'
  - 'npm start' 
- UI should be running on localhost:8080

## Notes
I could not for the life of me get mocking the _useSelector_ function from Redux to work for my testing, so the BoxesTable component is lacking tests. Would love to see how you guys would manage it.
